# How To Use
TODO: Ideally, you use a factory that takes in some config, instance of a batch writer, optional instance of a response processor
and it generates you the BatchSubmitter while starting up the background worker threads.

# How To Build

# Tenets
* Be as easy to use as possible
* Be as lightweight as possible (as few dependencies as possible)

# To-dos
# TODO: Maybe move it to an issue tracker
* Optional retry mechanism (that can be handled via BatchSubmitter right now)
* Move to Github
* Javadocs writing
* Javadocs generation
* Performance profiling
* License
